#### ATM Project-1 [Console Based]

This project is a simple console-based ATM system implemented in Python. It simulates basic ATM functionalities such as withdrawals, deposits, PIN management, and account information display. The project is designed for learning purposes and showcases a structured approach to handling user accounts and transactions.

### Features

#Withdraw Money

Allows users to withdraw money from their account.

Validates PIN and checks for sufficient balance before processing.

#Deposit Money

Users can deposit money into their account.

The balance is updated in real-time.

#PIN Generation

Users can set a new PIN for accounts that do not have an existing PIN.

#Mini Statement

Displays user account details, including:

Account holder's name

Registered email

Current balance

#PIN Change

Allows users to change their existing 4-digit PIN.

#Exit

Ends the ATM session.

## Data Structure

The program stores account details in a Python dictionary named accounts.

## Example:

accounts = {
    1001: [1000, 2408, "user1@gmail.com", "user1"],
    1002: [2000, 1234, "user2@gmail.com", "user2"],
    1003: [10000, None, "user3@gmail.com", "user3"]
}

Key: Account number (integer)

Value: A list containing:

Account balance (integer)

PIN (integer or None if not generated)

Registered email address (string)

Account holder's name (string)
